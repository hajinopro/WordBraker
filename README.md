This app is one of the first SwiftUI apps to use in my English study.
Image assets in this app might have legal problems, so be careful of commercial use.
This app has many functionalities such as List, TabView, NavigationStack, etc.
So, you could leverage this app to make your app very well.
This app is written in SwiftUI 16 and later.
Thanks....
